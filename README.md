# xml-exploit-examples

I was interested in playing around with the XML exploits from [Mateusz' blog post](https://blog.pragmatists.com/xml-be-cautious-69a981fdc56a), so I implemented them and tried it all out.

I also took some of [OWASP's cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) and tried the examples against it.

I'm using base java classes and a simple [bash script](run_me.sh) to build and run the examples to keep things simple and prevent this small bit of code to end up centered around a build tool (ant/maven/gradle) and dependencies (xerces, etc.).

## Usage

Running an example without the OWASP configurations:

```shell
./run_me.sh disk
```

Running an example with the OWASP configurations:

```shell
./run_me.sh disk secure
```
Help:

```shell
./run_me.sh help
```
